                                ABSTRACT

            Current Population Survey, March 1988-1991 on CD-ROM
        [machine-readable data file] / conducted by the Bureau of the
        Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  -Washington:  
        Bureau of the Census [producer and distributor], 1991.


Type of File:

Microdata; unit of observation is individuals, families, and households.

Universe Description:

The universe is the civilian noninstitutional population of the United
States living in housing units and members of the Armed Forces living in
civilian housing units on a military base or in a household not on a mili-
tary base.  A probability sample is used in selecting housing units.

Subject-Matter Description:

This file, also known as the Annual Demographic File, provides the usual
monthly labor force data, but in addition, provides supplemental data on
work experience, income, noncash benefits, and migration. Comprehensive
information is given on the employment status, occupation, and industry of
persons 15+ years old and over.  Additional data for persons 15 years old
and older are available concerning weeks worked and hours per week worked,
reason not working full time, total income and income components, and
residence on March 1 in year of survey.  Data on employment and income
refer to the preceding year, although demographic data refer to the time of
the survey.

This file also contains data covering nine noncash income sources: food
stamps, school lunch program, employer-provided group health insurance
plan, employer-provided pension plan, personal health insurance, Medicaid,
Medicare, CHAMPUS or military health care, and energy assistance.

Characteristics such as age, sex, race, household relationship, and
Hispanic origin are shown for each person in the household enumerated.

Geographic Coverage:

State of residence is uniquely identified as well as census geographic
division and region.  The 113 largest metropolitan statistical areas 
(CMSA's or MSA's), an additional 89 selected MSA's, 66 selected PMSA's, and 
30 central cities in multi-central city MSA's or PMSA's are also uniquely 
identified.(1)  Within confidentiality restrictions, indicators are 
provided for MSA-PMSA/non-MSA-PMSA, central city/noncentral city, 
farm/nonfarm, and MSA/CMSA size.

Related Printed Reports:

Data from the March Current Population Survey are published most frequently
in the Current Population Reports P-20 and P-60 series.  These reports are
available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing
Office, Washington, DC  20402.  Forthcoming reports will be cited in Census
and You, CENDATATM, the Monthly Product Announcement (MPA), and the Bureau
of the Census Catalog and Guide.

Related Machine-Readable Data Files:

A public use edition of the Current Population Survey, March file is
available for each year since 1968.  For 1980, 1984 and 1988 two March
files are available for each year.  The first March 1980 file contains
estimates based on 1970 population counts and should be used for historical
comparisons ending in 1980.  The reweighted March 1980 file contains
estimates based on results of the 1980 census and should be used for
comparisons between 1981 and 1984.

In 1984, the Bureau of the Census introduced a step into the March second
state weighting procedure controlling individual weights to independent
estimates of the Hispanic population.  Since this introduction caused a
major disruption in the Hispanic estimates from March two data files were
created.  The first file, without the Hispanic controls should be used for
comparing estimates for years prior to 1984 and the second file should be
used for comparison with 1985 and forward files.

From March 1989 forward, data on the Annual Demographic File are processed
using the rewrite system.  The rewrite system includes revised procedures
to match supplement records to basis CPS records; revised weighting
procedures; revised demographic and family edits; revised imputation proce-
dures; and more income detail on the file.

For March 1988 there are two files, the regular Annual Demographic File and
the Annual Demographic Rewrite File.  The rewrite file has been prepared to
allow historical comparison of data from the rewrite processing system
implemented between 1988 and 1989.  It is recommended that the rewrite file
be used when comparing data collected from the March Annual Demographic
Supplement from the 1988 forward.  Use the regular file, released in 1988,
when comparing data from 1988 and prior years.

This is not to say, however, that comparisons cannot be made between years
before and after 1988.  When such analyses are done, for example between
1986 through 1989, data users must consider that similarities or dif-
ferences between the data may be caused or effected by the rewritten
system.  Thus, comparing estimates from the 1988 rewrite files and the 1988
regular file will reveal the extent of any differences caused by the
processing system changes though not the specific change.  The magnitude of
the difference can then be applied to the estimates from 1986 - 1987 to
reveal whether any real differences exist.  There were several revisions
made to the processing programs; therefore, it is difficult to determine
which specific revision effected the differences or similarities in the
data.

Some non-March data also are available from 1968 to present.  For more

                       Specific Metropolitan Identifiers


The specific metropolitan identifiers on this file are based on the Office 
of Management and Budget's June 30, 1984 definitions and are ranked 
according to Census Bureau population estimates for July 1, 1983.  
Identification of CMSA's is based on the CMSA/MSA rank code (see List 1) or 
the CMSA FIPS Code (see List 5).  MSA's can be Identified by using either 
the CMSA/MSA rank code (List 1) or the FIPS MSA/PMSA code (List 4).  PMSA's 
can be Identified by either the FIPS MSA/PMSA code (List 4) or a 
combination of the CMSA/MSA rank codes and the PMSA rank code (List 2).  
Identification of Individual central cities is based on a combination of 
codes (See List 3).  Individual central cities are identified by the 
appropriate central city code and the FIPS MSA/PMSA code or the appropriate 
central city code, the CMSA/MSA rank code, and, if necessary, the PMSA rank 
code.  Some examples of the proper coding of specific metropolitan areas 
are given below.

NOTES:

1.  Do not attempt to tally CMSA totals by summing identified PMSA' s.  The
specific PMSA identification for some PMSA `s is suppressed while the 
specific CMSA for those areas is available.  The New Hampshire portion of 
the Boston CMSA is an example of this. While specific identification of 
Nashua and the Lawrence-Haverill and Lowell portions is suppressed, all 
areas are coded as being in the Boston CMSA.


2.  Many of the smaller metropolitan areas in sample do not contain central 
city/balance breakdowns and hence, are coded "not identifiable" in the 
household central city metropolitan statistical area residence status code 
(HCCC-R).  It is recommended that this code in conjunction with the 
modified household metropolitan statistical area residence status code 
(HMSA-R) be used for tallying metropolitan residence status for national 
and other grouped data.  The HG in each listing refers to Household 
Geographic.

This variable will be topcoded based on an individual's usual hours worked 
variable, if the individual's edited usual weekly earnings variable is 
$999.  The topcode is computed such that the product of usual hours times 
usual hourly does not exceed an annualized wage of $100,000 ($1923.07 per 
week).  Below is a list of the appropriate topcodes.

     Source and Accuracy of the Data for the March 1989
          Current Population Survey Microdata File

SOURCE OF DATA

The data for this survey came from the March 1989 Current
Population Survey (CPS), conducted by the Bureau of the
Census. The March survey uses two sets of questions, the
basic CPS and the supplements.

Basic CPS.  The monthly CPS collects primarily labor force
data about the civilian noninstitutional population. 
Interviewers ask questions concerning labor force
participation about each member 14 years old and over in
every sample household.  The present CPS sample was selected
from the 1980 Decennial Census files with coverage in all 50
states and the District of Columbia.  The sample is
continually updated to account for new residential
construction.  It is located in 729 areas comprising 1,973
counties, independent cities, and minor civil divisions.  
About 56,100 occupied households are eligible for interview
every month. Interviewers are unable to obtain interviews at
about 2,500 of these units because the occupants are not
home after repeated calls or are unavailable for some other
reason.

Since the introduction of the CPS, the Bureau of the Census
has redesigned the CPS sample several times to improve the
quality and reliability of the data and to satisfy changing
data needs.  The most recent changes were completely
implemented in July 1985.

March supplement.  In addition to the basic CPS questions,
interviewers asked supplementary questions in March about
money income received in the previous calendar year,
educational attainment, household and family
characteristics, marital status and geographical mobility.

To obtain more reliable data for the Hispanic origin
population, the March CPS sample was increased by about
2,500 eligible housing units, interviewed the previous
November, that contained at least one sample person of
Hispanic origin.  In addition, the sample included persons
in the Armed Forces living off post or with their families
on post.

Estimation procedure.  This survey's estimation procedure
inflates weighted sample results to independent estimates of
the civilian noninstitutional population of the United
States by age, sex, race and Hispanic/non-Hispanic
categories.  The independent estimates were based on
statistics from decennial censuses of population; statistics
on births, deaths, immigration and emigration; and
statistics on the
size of the Armed Forces.  The estimation procedure for the
March supplement included a further adjustment so husband
and wife of a household received the same weight.


ACCURACY OF THE ESTIMATES

Since the CPS estimates come from a sample, they may differ
from figures from a complete census using the same
questionnaires, instructions, and enumerators.  A sample
survey estimate has two possible types of error:  sampling
and nonsampling.  The accuracy of an estimate depends on
both types of error, but the full extent of the nonsampling
error is unknown.  Consequently, one should be particularly
careful when interpreting results based on a relatively
small number of cases or on small differences between
estimates.

Nonsampling variability.  Nonsampling errors can be
attributed to many sources.  These sources include the
inability to obtain information about all cases in the
sample, definitional difficulties, differences in the
interpretation of questions, respondents' inability or
unwillingness to provide correct information or to recall
information, errors made in data collection such as in
recording or coding the data, errors made in processing the
data, errors made in estimating values for missing data, and
failure to represent all units with the sample
(undercoverage).

CPS undercoverage results from missed housing units and
missed persons within sample households.  Compared to the
level of the 1980 Decennial Census, overall CPS
undercoverage is about 7 percent.  CPS undercoverage varies
with age, sex, and race.  Generally, undercoverage is larger
for males than for females and larger for Blacks and other
races combined than for Whites.  As described previously,
ratio estimation to independent age-sex-race-Hispanic
population controls partially corrects for the bias due to
undercoverage.  However, biases exist in the estimates to
the extent that missed persons in missed households or
missed persons in interviewed households have different
characteristics from those of interviewed persons in the
same age-sex-race-Hispanic group.  Furthermore, the
independent population controls have not been adjusted for
undercoverage in the 1980 census.

For additional information on nonsampling error including
the possible impact on CPS data when known, refer to

Employment as Measured by the Current Population Survey,

the Census, U.S. Department of Commerce.


Comparability of data.  Data obtained from the CPS and other
sources are not entirely comparable.  This results from
differences in interviewer training and experience and in
differing survey processes.  This is an example of
nonsampling variability not reflected in the standard
errors.  Use caution when comparing results from different
sources.

Caution should also be used when comparing data from this
microdata file, which reflects 1980 census-based population
controls, with microdata files from March 1980 and earlier
years, which reflect 1970 census-based population controls.  
This change in population controls had relatively little
impact on summary measures such as means, medians, and
percentage distributions, but did have a significant impact
on levels.  For example, use of 1980 based population
controls results in about a 2-percent increase in the
civilian noninstitutional population and in the number of
families and households.  Thus, estimates of levels for data
collected in 1981 and later years will differ from those for
earlier years by more than what could be attributed to
actual changes in the population.  These differences could
be disproportionately greater for certain subpopulation
groups than for the total population.

Since no independent population control totals for persons
of Hispanic origin were used before 1984, compare Hispanic
estimates over time cautiously.

Note when using small estimates.  Because of the large
standard errors involved, summary measures probably do not
reveal useful information when computed on a base smaller
than 75,000.

Take care in the interpretation of small differences.  For
instance, even a small amount of nonsampling error can cause
a borderline difference to appear significant or not, thus
distorting a seemingly valid hypothesis test.

Sampling variability.  Sampling variability is variation
that occurred by chance because a sample was surveyed rather
than the entire population.  Standard errors are primarily
measures of sampling variability, although they may include
some nonsampling error.  

Standard errors and their use.  A number of approximations
are required to derive, at a moderate cost, standard errors
applicable to estimates from this data.  Instead of
providing an individual standard error, generalized sets of
standard errors are provided for various types of
characteristics.  Thus, the tables show levels of magnitude
of standard errors rather than the precise standard errors.

The sample estimate and its standard error enable one to
construct a confidence interval, a range that would include
the average result of all possible samples with a known
probability.  For example, if all possible samples were
surveyed under essentially the same general conditions and
using the same sample design, and if an estimate and its
standard error were calculated from each sample, then
approximately 90 percent of the intervals from 1.6 standard
errors below the estimate to 1.6 standard errors above the
estimate would include the average result of all possible
samples.

A particular confidence interval may or may not contain the
average estimate derived from all possible samples.  
However, one can say with specified confidence that the
interval includes the average estimate calculated from all
possible samples.

Standard errors may be used to perform hypothesis testing, a
procedure for distinguishing between population parameters
using sample estimates.  The most common type of hypothesis
is that the population parameters are different.  An example
of this would be comparing the percentage of Whites with a
college education to the percentage of Blacks with a college
education.

Tests may be performed at various levels of significance,
where a significance level is the probability of concluding
that the characteristics are different when, in fact, they
are the same.  For example, for a statement of difference to
pass at the 0.10 level of significance, the absolute value
of the estimated difference between characteristics is
greater than or equal to 1.6 times the standard error of the
difference.

The Census Bureau uses 90-percent confidence intervals and
0.10 levels of significance to determine statistical
validity.  Consult standard statistical texts for
alternative criteria.

Standard errors of estimated numbers.   There are two ways to
compute the approximate standard error, sx, of an estimated
number. The first uses the formula


                          sx = fs                       (1)


where f is a factor from Table III, and s is the standard
error of the estimate obtained by interpolation from Table
I.A or II.A.  The second method uses formula (2), from
which the standard errors in Tables I.A and II.A were
calculated.  This formula will provide more accurate results
than formula (1).
                            
                       sx = ax + bx                   (2)

Here x is the size of the estimate and a and b are the
parameters in Table IV associated with the particular type
of characteristic.  When calculating standard errors for
numbers from cross-tabulations involving different
characteristics, use the factor or set of parameters for the
characteristic which will give the largest standard error.

Illustration

Suppose there were 8,419,000 high school graduates aged 20
to 24 years old.  Using formula (2) with a = -0.000015 and b
= 2,744 from Table IV, the approximate standard error is
     
sx = (-0.000015)(8,419,000) + (2,744)(8,419,000) = 148,000.

Using the 148,000 estimate of standard error, the 90-percent
confidence interval is from 8,182,200 to 8,655,800, i.e.,
8,419,000  (1.6)(148,000).  Therefore, a conclusion that
the average estimate lies within a range computed in this
way would be correct for roughly 90 percent of all possible
samples.

Alternatively, using formula (1) and values of f and s from
Tables III and I.A, respectively, the approximate standard
error is 1.00147,000 = 147,000.

Standard errors of estimated percentages.  The reliability
of an estimated percentage, computed using sample data for
both numerator and denominator, depends on the size of the
percentage and its base.  Estimated percentages are
relatively more reliable than the corresponding estimates of
the numerators of the percentages, particularly if the
percentages are 50 percent or more.  When the numerator and
denominator of the percentage are in different categories,
use the factor or parameter from Tables III and IV indicated
by the numerator.

The approximate standard error, sx,p, of an estimated
percentage can be obtained by use of the formula


                         sx,p = fs                      (3)


In this formula, f is the appropriate factor from Table III
and s is the standard error of the estimate obtained by
interpolation from Tables I.B.1 through I.B.9 or II.B.1
through II.B.5.
Alternatively, formula (4) will provide more accurate
results:
                           
                           b
                    sx,p =  p(100 - p)                (4)
                           x

Here x is the total number of persons, families, households,
or unrelated individuals in the base of the percentage, p is
the percentage (0  p  100), and b is the parameter in
Table IV associated with the characteristic in the numerator
of the percentage.

Illustration

Suppose there were 8,419,000 high school graduates aged 20
to 24 of whom 12 percent were Black.  Using formula (4),
with b = 3,086, the approximate standard error is
               
        sx,p = (3,086/8,419,000)(12.0)(88.0) = 0.6.

Alternatively, using formula (3), the approximate standard
error is 1.060.6 = 0.6.

Consequently, the 90-percent confidence interval for the
percentage of high school graduates aged 20 to 24 who were
Black is from 11.0 to 13.0 percent, i.e., 12.0  (1.6)(0.6).

Standard error of a difference.  The standard error of the
difference between two sample estimates is approximately
equal to
                            
                     sx-y = sx + sy                  (5)

where sx and sy are the standard errors of the estimates, x
and y.  The estimates can be numbers, percentages, ratios,
etc.  This will represent the actual standard error quite
accurately for the difference between estimates of the same
characteristic in two different areas, or for the difference
between separate and uncorrelated characteristics in the
same area.  However, if there is a high positive (negative)
correlation between the two characteristics, the formula
will overestimate (underestimate) the true standard error.

Illustration

Suppose 8,419,000 persons 25 to 29 years old and 8,228,000
persons 20 to 24 years old had completed four years of high
school and no more.  The apparent difference is 191,000
persons.  The standard error on 8,419,000 was previously
shown to be approximately 148,000 persons.  The standard
error on 8,228,000, computed in the same way, is
approximately 147,000 persons.  Using formula (5), the
standard error of the estimated difference of 191,000
persons is about
                  
           sx-y = 148,000 + 147,000 = 209,000.

This means that the 90-percent confidence interval around
the difference is from -143,400 to 525,400.  Since this
interval contains zero, we cannot conclude that the number
of persons who completed four years of high school and no
more is different for 20 to 24 year olds and 25 to 29 year
olds.

Standard error of a mean for grouped data.  The formula used
to estimate the standard error of a mean for grouped data is


                            
                       s_ = (b/y)S                    (6)
                        x

In this formula, y is the size of the base of the
distribution and b is a parameter from Table IV.  The
variance, S, is given by the following formula:

                           c   _     _
                     S =   pixi - x                 (7)
                          i=1
      _
where x, the mean of the distribution, is estimated by

                         _   c   _                      (8)
                         x =  pixi
                            i=1

c is the number of groups; i indicates a specific group,
thus taking on values 1 through c.

pi is the estimated proportion of households, families or
persons whose values, for the characteristic (x-values)
being considered, fall in group i.
_
xi is (Zi-1 + Zi)/2 where Zi-1 and Zi are the lower and
                                                       _
upper interval boundaries, respectively, for group i.  xi is
assumed to be the most representative value for the
characteristic for households, families, and unrelated
individuals or persons in group i.  Group c is open-ended,
i.e., no upper interval boundary exists.  For this group the
approximate average value is

                        _    3
                        xc =  Zc-1                    (9)
                             2
Standard error of a ratio.  Certain estimates may be
calculated as the ratio of two numbers.  The standard error
of a ratio, x/y, may be computed using

                        
                      x sx  sy      sxsy
             sx/y  =  -  +   - 2r        (10)
                      y x    y         xy

The standard error of the numerator, sx, and that of the
denominator, sy, may be calculated using formula (2).
Alternatively, use formula (1) and Table I.A or II.A.  In
formula (10), r represents the correlation between the
numerator and the denominator of the estimate.

For one type of ratio, the denominator is a count of
families or households and the numerator is a count of
persons in those families or households with a certain
characteristic.  If there is at least one person with the
characteristic in every family or household, use 0.7 as an
estimate of r.  An example of this type is the mean number
of children per family with children.

For all other types of ratios, r is assumed to be zero.  If
r is actually positive (negative), then this procedure will
provide an overestimate (underestimate) of the standard
error of the ratio.  Examples of this type are the mean
number of children per family and the poverty rate.

NOTE:  For estimates expressed as the ratio of x per 100 y
or x per 1,000 y, multiply formula (10) by 100 or 1,000,
respectively, to obtain the standard error.

Standard error of a median.  The sampling variability of an
estimated median depends on the form of the distribution and
the size of the base.  One can approximate the reliability
of an estimated median by determining a confidence interval
about it.  (See the section on sampling variability for a
general discussion of confidence intervals.)

Estimate the 68-percent confidence limits of a median based
on sample data using the following procedure.

1. Determine, using formula (4), the standard error of the
   estimate of 50 percent from the distribution.

2. Add to and subtract from 50 percent the standard error
   determined in step 1.

3. Using the distribution of the characteristic, determine
   upper and lower limits of the 68-percent confidence
   interval by calculating values corresponding to the two
   points established in step 2.

Use the following formula to calculate the upper and
   lower limits.

                        pN - N1
                  XpN =  (A2 - A1) + A1        (11)
                        N2 - N1

where

XpN = estimated upper and lower bounds for the confidence
   interval (0  p  1).  For purposes of calculating the
   confidence interval, p takes on the values determined in
   step 2.  Note that XpN estimates the median when p =
   0.50.

N = for distribution of numbers:  the total number of
       units (persons, households, etc.) for the
       characteristic in the distribution.

  = for distribution of percentages:  the value 1.0.

p = the values obtained in step 2

A1, A2 = the lower and upper bounds, respectively, of the
   interval containing XpN.

N1, N2 = for distribution of numbers:  the estimated
   number of units (persons, households, etc.) with values
   of the characteristic greater than or equal to A1 and
   A2, respectively.

= for distribution of percentages: the estimated
   percentage of units (persons, households, etc.) having
   values of the characteristic greater than or equal to A1
   and A2, respectively.

4. Divide the difference between the two points determined
   in step 3 by two to obtain the standard error of the
   median.

Illustration

Suppose the median income for families was $30,853 in 1988.  
The size, or base, of the distribution from which this
median was determined was 65,133,000 families.

(1) Using formula (2) with b = 1,896, the standard error of
    50 percent on a base of 65,133,000 is about 0.3 percent.

(2) To obtain a 68-percent confidence interval on an
    estimated median, add to and subtract from 50 percent
    the standard error found in step 1.  This yields percent
    limits of 49.7 and 50.3.
(3)The lower and upper limits for the interval in which
    the median falls are $30,000 and $32,500, respectively.

Then, by addition, the estimated numbers of families
    with an income greater than or equal to $30,000 and
    $32,500 are 33,633,000 and 30,508,000, respectively.

Using formula (5), the upper limit for the confidence
    interval of the median is found to be about

    0.49765,133,000 - 33,633,000
    (32,500 - 30,000) + 30,000
       30,508,000 - 33,633,000

    = 31,010.

Similarly, the lower limit is found to be about

   0.50365,133,000 - 33,633,000
   (32,500 - 30,000) + 30,000
       30,508,000 - 33,633,000

= 30,697.

Thus, a 68-percent confidence interval for the median
    income for families is from $30,697 to $31,010.

(4) The standard error of the median is, therefore,

                  31,010 - 30,697
                   = 157.
                         2

Accuracy of state estimates.  The 1980 redesign provided an
opportunity to increase efficiency and accuracy of state
data.  All strata are defined within state boundaries.  The
sample is allocated among the states to produce state and
national estimates with the required accuracy while keeping
total sample size to a minimum.  Improved accuracy of state
data has been achieved with about the same sample size as in
the 1970 design.

Since the CPS is designed to produce both state and national
estimates, the proportion of the total population sampled
and the sampling rates differ among the states.  In general,
the smaller the population of the state the larger the
sampling proportion.  For example, in Vermont approximately
1 in every 300 households was sampled each month.  In New
York the sample was about 1 in every 1,600 households.  
Nevertheless, the size of the sample in New York is four
times larger than in Vermont because New York has a larger
population.
Computation of standard errors for state estimates.
Standard errors for states and selected groups of states,
may be obtained by adjusting national level generalized
standard errors or a and b parameters in conjunction with
the standard error equations described earlier.  To use the
generalized standard errors for estimates of levels,
multiply the national level standard errors in Tables I.A
and II.A by f in Table V for the state of interest.  For
estimates of percentages, f should be used with the factors
in Table III and the standard errors in Tables I.B.1 through
I.B.9 or II.B.1 through II.B.5.

As an example, suppose the sample shows that there were
2,182,000 persons of Hispanic origin living in New York,
32.4 percent of whom had completed four years or more of
high school.  Interpolation in Table I.B.1 shows the
standard error on 32.4 percent to be approximately 1.54.  
Table III shows the factor for persons of Hispanic origin
with educational attainment to be 1.06.  Table V shows the
factor for New York to be 1.06.  Thus, the standard error on
the 32.4 percent of persons of Hispanic origin who completed
four years of high school or more is approximately equal to
1.7 = 1.54  1.06  1.06.

To use a and b parameters in calculating state standard
errors for estimates of levels, multiply the national a and
b parameters from Table IV by f in Table V for the state of
interest.  For estimates of percentages the b parameter
only, from Table IV, is multiplied by f from Table V.

Computation of a factor for groups of states.  The factor
for a group of states may be obtained by computing a
weighted sum of the factors for the individual states in the
group, depending on the combination of states, the resulting
figure can be an overestimate.  The factor for a group of n
states is given by

             n
              1980 census population of state i  fi
            i=1
       f = 
             n
              1980 census population of state i
            i=1

where fi is obtained from Table V.  The 1980 census
population for each state is given in Table V.  Use f for
factors for a and b parameters and f for factors for
standard errors.

For example, suppose a factor for the state group Illinois-
Wisconsin-Michigan was desired.  The correct factor would be
    11,427,4140.86 + 4,705,6421.22 + 9,262,0700.68
f =  = 0.86
          11,427,414 + 4,705,642 + 9,262,070

   in conjunction with Table III.

   The a parameters for states are obtained by multiplying
   f by the a parameter in Table IV of the characteristic
   of interest for the Total or White or all races category
   only.  f is applied to the b parameter for any race or
   Hispanic Origin.

                              Subject Concepts


Age.  Age classification is based on the age of the person at his/her last
birthday.  The adult universe (i.e., population of marriageable age) is
comprised of persons 15 years old and over for March supplement data and
for CPS labor force data.

Annuities.  (See Income.)

Armed Forces.  Armed Forces members enumerated in off-base housing or on
base with their families are included on the CPS data file in March.  In
addition to demographic and family data, supplemental data on income
are included for Air Forces members.

Base Weight.  The constant weight assigned to the sample (inverse of the
sampling fraction) which is adjusted to produce the final weight.

Civilian Labor Force.  (See Labor Force.)

Class of Worker.  This refers to the broad classification of the person's
employer.  On the March file, these broad classifications for current jobs
are private, government, self-employed, without pay, and never worked.
Private and government workers are considered "wage and salary workers;"
this classification scheme includes self-employed, incorporated persons in
with "private" workers.  For the longest job held last year, this class
of worker scheme includes private; government by level/Federal, State, and
local; self-employed incorporated, self-employed unincorporated or farm;
and without pay.  The wage and salary category for longest job held
includes private, government (all levels), and self-employed incorporated.

Dividends.  (See Income.)

Duration of Unemployment.  Duration of unemployment represents the length
of time (through the current survey week) during which persons classified
as unemployed are continuously looking for work.  For persons on layoff,
duration of unemployment represents the number of full weeks since the
termination of their most recent employment.  A period of two weeks or more
during which a person is employed or ceased looking for work is considered
to break the continuity of the present period of seeking work.  Average
duration is an arithmetic mean computed from a distribution by single weeks
of unemployment.

Earners, Number of.  The file includes all persons 15 years old and over in
the household with $1 or more in wages and salaries, or $1 or more of a
loss in net income from farm or nonfarm self-employment during the
preceding year.

Earnings Weight.  Each person record in month-in-sample 4 and 8 contains an
earnings weight for current earnings.

Education.  (See Years of School Completed.)

Employed.  (See Labor Force.)

Energy Assistance Program.  The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program
provides financial assistance to qualified households to help them pay
heating costs.  The program is funded by the Federal government and
administered by the States under broad guidelines.  In some States a house-
hold may automatically be eligible for this program if the household
receives (1) Aid to Families with Dependent Children, (2) Food Stamps, (3)
Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and (4) certain Veterans' benefits.
The energy assistance questions were asked for the first time in 1982.
Questions asked in the March 1989 survey included (1) recipient since
October 1, 1988, and (2) total amount received during the reference period.

ESR (Employment Status Recode).  This classification is available for each
civilian 15 years old and over according to his/her responses to the
monthly (basic) labor force items in March.

Family.  A family is a group of two persons or more (one of whom is the
householder) residing together and related by birth, marriage, or adoption.
All such persons (including related subfamily members) are considered as
members of one family.  Beginning with the 1980 CPS, unrelated subfamilies
(referred to in the past as secondary families) are no longer included in
the count of families, nor are the members of unrelated subfamilies
included in the count of family members.

Family Household.  A family household is a household maintained by a family
(as defined above), and may include among the household members any
unrelated persons (unrelated subfamily members and/or unrelated individu-
als) who may be residing there.  The number of family households is equal
to the number of families.  The count of family household members differs
from the count of family members, however, in that the family household
members include all persons living in the household, whereas family members
include only the householder and his/her relatives.  (See the definition of
Family).

Family Weight.  The weight on the family record is the March supplement
weight of the householder or reference person.  This weight on the primary
family record should be used to tabulate the number of families.

Farm Self-Employment Net Income.  The term is defined as net money income
(gross receipts minus operating expenses) from the operation of a farm by a
person on his own account, as an owner, as a renter, or as a sharecropper.
Gross receipts include the value of all products sold, government crop
loans, money received from the rental of farm equipment to others, and
incidental receipts from the sale of wood, sand, gravel, etc.

Operation expenses include cost of feed, fertilizer, seed, and other
farming supplies, cash wages paid to farm hands, depreciation charges, cash
rent, interest on farm mortgages, farm building repairs, farm taxes (not
State and Federal income taxes), etc. The value of fuel, food, or other
farm products used for household living is not included as part of net
income.  Inventory changes are considered in determining net income only
when they are accounted for in replies based on income tax returns or other
official records which reflect inventory changes.

Final Weight.  Used in tabulating monthly labor force items.  This weight
should be used when producing estimates from the basic CPS data.  It should
not be used to tabulate March supplement data.

Food Stamps.  The Food Stamp Act of 1977 was enacted for the purpose of
increasing the food purchasing power of eligible households through the use
of coupons to purchase food.  The Food and Nutrition Service of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) administers the Food Stamp Program through
State and local welfare offices.  The Food Stamp Program is the major
national income support program which provides benefits to all low-income
and low-resource households regardless of household characteristics (e.g.,
sex, age, disability, etc.).  The questions on participation in the Food
Stamp Program in the March CPS were designed to identify households in
which one or more of the current members received food stamps during the
previous calendar year.  Once a food stamp household was identified, a
question was asked to determine the number of current household members
covered by food stamps during the previous calendar year.  Questions were
also asked about the number of months food stamps were received during the
previous calendar year and the total face value of all food stamps received
during that period.

Full-Time Worker.  Persons on full-time schedules include persons working
35 hours or more, persons who worked 1-34 hours for noneconomic reasons
(e.g., illness) and usually work full-time, and persons "with a job but
not at work" who usually work full-time.

Group Health Insurance Coverage.  Civilian persons 15 years old and over
who worked in the previous calendar year and who participated in group
health insurance plans provided by the employer or union were asked whether
part or all of the health insurance premiums were paid for by the union or
employer and the extent of persons covered.

Additional questions were asked to determine if sample persons were covered
by any other type of health insurance plan.  These items are intended to
measure retirees covered by continuing employer provided coverage and per-
sons who purchased coverage on their own.

Group Quarters.  Group quarters are noninstitutional living arrangements
for groups not living in conventional housing units or groups living in
housing units containing nine or more persons unrelated to the person in
charge.

Head Versus Householder.  Beginning with the March 1980 CPS, the Bureau of
the Census discontinued the use of the terms "head of household" and
"head of family."  Instead, the terms "householder" and "family
householder" are used.

Highest Grade of School Attended.  (See Years of School Completed.)

Hispanic Origin.  Persons of Hispanic origin in this file are determined on
the basis of a question that asked for self-identification of the person's
origin or descent.  Respondents are asked to select their origin (or the
origin of some other household member) from a "flash card" listing ethnic
origins.  Persons of Hispanic origin, in particular, are those who indi-
cated that their origin was Mexican-American, Chicano, Mexican, Mexicano,
Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Hispanic.

Hours of Work.  Hours of work statistics relate to the actual number of
hours worked during the survey week.  For example, a person who normally
works 40 hours a week but who is off on the Veterans Day holiday is
reported as working 32 hours even though he is paid for the holiday.
For persons working in more than one job, the figures relate to the number
of hours worked in all jobs during the week.  However, all the hours are
credited to the major job.

Household.  A household consists of all the persons who occupy a house, an
apartment, or other group of rooms, or a room, which constitutes a housing
unit.  A group of rooms or a single room is regarded as a housing unit when
it is occupied as separate living quarters; that is, when the occupants do
not live and eat with any other person in the structure, and when there is
direct access from the outside or through a common hall.  The count of
households  excludes persons living in group quarters, such as rooming
houses, military barracks, and institutions.  Inmates of institutions
(mental hospitals, rest homes, correctional institutions, etc.) are not in-
cluded in the survey.

Household Weight.  Household weight is the March Supplement weight of the
householder.  This weight should be used to tabulate estimates of
households.

Householder.  The householder refers to the person (or one of the persons)
in whose name the housing unit is owned or rented (maintained) or, if there
is no such person, any adult member, excluding roomers, boarders, or paid
employees.  If the house is owned or rented jointly by a married couple,
the householder may be either the husband or the wife.  The person
designated as the householder on the file is the "reference person" on
the CPS-260 control card to whom the relationship of all other household
members, if any, is recorded.

Householder With No Other Relatives in Household.  A householder who has no
relatives living in the household.  This is the entry for a person living
alone.  Another example is the designated householder of an apartment
shared by two or more unrelated individuals.

Householder With Other Relatives (Including Spouse) in Household.  The
person designated as householder if he/she has one or more relatives
(including spouse) living in the household.

Income.  For each person in the sample who is 15 years old and over,
questions are asked on the amount of money income received in the preceding
calendar year from each of the following sources:  (1) money wages or
salary; (2) net income from nonfarm self-employment; (3) net income from
farm self-employment; (4)  Social Security or railroad retirement; (5)
Supplemental Security Income; (6) public assistance or welfare payments;
(7) interest (on savings or bonds); (8) dividends, income from estates or
trusts, or net rental income; (9) veterans' payment or unemployment and
workmen's compensation; (10) private pensions or government employee
pensions; (11) alimony or child support, regular contributions from persons
not living in the household, and other periodic income.

Although income statistics refer to receipts during the preceding year, the
characteristics of the person such as age, labor force status, etc., and
the composition of households refer to the time of the survey.  The income
of the household does not include amounts received by persons who are
members of the household during all or part of the income year if these
persons no longer reside with the household at the time of enumeration.  On
the other hand,  household income includes amounts reported by persons who
did not reside with the household during the income year but who were
members of the household at the time of enumeration.

Data on consumer income collected in the CPS by the Bureau of the Census
cover money income received (exclusive of certain money receipts such as
capital gains) before payments for personal income taxes, Social Security,
union dues, Medicare deductions, etc.  Also, money income does not reflect
the fact that some households receive part of their income in the form of
nonmoney transfers such as food stamps, health benefits, subsidized
housing, and energy assistance; that many farm households receive nonmoney
income in the form of rent free housing and goods produced and consumed on
the farm; or that nonmoney income is received by some nonfarm residents
that often takes the form of the use of business transportation and
facilities, or full or partial contributions for retirement programs,
medical and educational expenses, etc.  These elements should be considered
when comparing income levels.  Moreover, readers should be aware that for
many different reasons there is a tendency in household surveys for
respondents to under report their income.  From an analysis of
independently derived income estimates, it has been determined that wages
and salaries tend to be much better reported than such income types as
public assistance, Social Security, and net income from interest, divi-
dends, rents, etc.

Income Sources - Wages and Salary.  Money wages or salary is defined as
total money earnings received for work performed as an employee during the
income year.  It includes wages, salary, Armed Forces pay, commissions,
tips, piece-rate payments, and cash bonuses earned, before deductions are
made for taxes, bonds, pensions, union dues, etc.  Earnings for self-
employed incorporated businesses are considered wage and salary.

Income Sources - Nonfarm Self-Employment.  Net income from nonfarm self-
employment is net money income (gross receipts minus expenses) from one's
own business, professional enterprise, or partnership.  Gross receipts
include the value of all goods sold and services rendered.  Expenses in-
clude costs of goods purchased, rent, heat, light, power, depreciation
charges, wages and salaries paid, business taxes (not personal income
taxes), etc.  In general, inventory changes are considered in determining
net income since replies based on income tax returns or other official
records do reflect inventory changes.  However, when values of inventory
changes are not reported, net income figures exclusive of inventory changes
are accepted.  The value of saleable merchandise consumed by the pro-
prietors of retail stores is not included as part of net income.

Income Sources - Farm Self-Employment.  Net income from farm self-
employment is net money income (gross receipts minus operating expenses)
from the operation of a farm by a person on his own account, as an owner,
as a renter, or as a sharecropper.  Gross receipts include the value of all
products sold, government crop loans, money received from the rental of
farm equipment to others, and incidental receipts from the sale of wood,
sand, gravel, etc.

Operating expenses include cost of feed, fertilizer, seed, and other
farming supplies, cash wages paid to farm hands, depreciation charges, cash
rent, interest on farm mortgages, farm building repairs, farm taxes (not
State and Federal income taxes), etc.  The value of fuel, food, or other
farm products used for family living is not included as part of net income.
In general, inventory changes are considered in determining net income only
when they are accounted for in replies based on income tax returns or other
official records which reflect inventory changes; otherwise, inventory
changes are not taken into account.

Income Sources - Social Security.  Social Security includes Social Security
pensions and survivors' benefits, and permanent disability insurance
payments made by the Social Security Administration prior to deductions for
medical insurance and railroad retirement insurance checks from the U.S.
Government.  "Medicare" reimbursements are not included.

Income Sources - Supplemental Security Income.  Supplemental Security
Income includes payments made by Federal, State, and local welfare agencies
to low income persons who are (1) aged (65 years old and over), (2) blind,
or (3) disabled.

Income Sources - Public Assistance.  Public assistance or welfare payments
include public assistance payments such as Aid to Families with Dependent
Children and general assistance.

Income Sources - Interest and Dividends.  Interest, dividends, income from
estates or trusts, net rental income or royalties include dividends from
stockholdings or membership in associations, interest on savings or bonds,
periodic receipts from estates or trust funds, net income from rental of a
house, store, or other property to others, receipts from boarders or
lodgers, and net royalties.

Income Sources - Unemployment Compensation, Worker's Compensation, and
Veterans' Payments.  Unemployment compensation, veterans' payments, or
worker's compensation includes:  (1) unemployment compensation received
from government unemployment insurance agencies or private companies during
periods of unemployment and any strike benefits received from union funds;
(2) money paid periodically by the Veterans Administration to disabled
members of the Armed Forces or to survivors of deceased veterans,
subsistence allowances paid to veterans for education and on-the-job
training, as well as so-called "refunds" paid to ex-servicemen as GI
insurance premiums; and (3) worker's compensation received periodically
from public or private insurance companies for injuries incurred at work.
The cost of this insurance must have been paid by the employer and not by
the person.

Income Sources - Private and Government Pensions and Annuities.  Many
employers and unions have established pension program their employees so
that upon retirement the employee will receive regular income to replace
his/her earnings.  Many of these programs also provide income to the em-
ployees if he/she becomes severely disabled, or to his/her survivors if the
employee dies.  Other types of retirement income include annuities and paid
up life insurance policies.  Some people purchase annuities which yield a
set amount over a certain number of years.  Other people may convert their
paid up life insurance policy into an annuity after they retire.

Income Sources - Alimony and Child Support.  Alimony is money received
periodically from a former spouse following a divorce or separation.  Child
support is money received from a parent for the support of their children
following a divorce or legal separation.  Money received from relatives,
other then the parent, or friends is not considered as child support.

Receipts Not Counted As Income.  Receipts from the following sources are
not included as income:  (1) money received from the sale of property, such
as stocks, bonds, a house, or a car (unless the person is engaged in the
business  of selling such property, in which case the net proceeds is
counted as income from self-employment); (2) withdrawals of bank deposits;
(3) money borrowed;  (4) tax refunds; (5) gifts; and (6) lump-sum
inheritances of insurance payments.

Industry, Occupation, and Class of Worker (I&O) - Current Job (basic data).
For the employed, current job is the job held in the reference week (the
week before the survey).  Persons with two or more jobs are classified in
the job at which they worked the most hours during the reference week.  The
unemployed are classified according to their latest full-time job lasting
two or more weeks or by the job (either full-time or part-time) from which
they were on layoff.  The I & O questions are also asked of persons not in
the labor force who are in the fourth and eighth months in sample and who
have worked in the last five years.  The occupation/industry classification
system for the 1980 Census of Population was used to code March CPS data
beginning with the March 1983 file.

Industry, Occupation, and Class of Worker-Longest Job (supplement data).
Longest job applies to the job held longest during the preceding year for
persons who worked that year, without regard to their current employment
status.

___________________________________________________________________________

Job Seekers.  All unemployed persons who made specific efforts to find a
job sometime during the 4-week period preceding the survey week.

Keeping House.  Persons are classified as keeping house if they engage in
own housework.  This is one of the "not in labor force" classifications
employment status recode (ESR) = 4.

Labor Force.  Persons are classified as in the labor force if they are
employed, unemployed, or in the Armed Forces during the survey week.  The
"civilian labor force" includes all civilians classified as employed or
unemployed.  The file includes labor force data for civilians age 15 and
over.  However, the official definition of the civilian labor force is age
16 and over.

1.   Employed.  Employed persons comprise (1) all civilians who, during the
survey week did any work at all as paid employees or in their own business
or profession, or on their own farm, or who work 15 hours or more as unpaid
workers on a farm or a business operated by a member of the family; and (2)
all those who have jobs but who are not working because of illness, bad
weather, vacation, or labor-management dispute, or because they are taking
time off for personal reasons, whether or not they are seeking other jobs.
These persons would have an Labor Force Status Recode (LFSR) of 1 or 2
respectively in character 12 of the person record which designates "at
work" and "with a job, but not at work."  Each employed person is
counted only once.  Those persons who held more than one job are counted in
the job at which they worked the greatest number of hours during the survey
week.  If they worked an equal number of hours at more than one job, they
are counted at the job they held the longest.

2.   Unemployed.  Unemployed persons are those civilians who, during the
survey week, have no employment but are available for work, and (1) have
engaged in any specific job seeking activity within the past 4 weeks such
as registering at a public or private employment office, meeting with
prospective employers, checking with friends or relatives, placing or
answering advertisements, writing letters of application, or being on a
union or professional register; (2) are waiting to be called back to a job
from which they had been laid off; or (3) are waiting to report to a new
wage or salary job within 30 days.  These persons would have an LFSR code
of 3 in character 12 of the person record.  The unemployed includes job
leavers, job losers, new job entrants, and job reentrants.

   a.   Job Leavers.  Persons who quit or otherwise terminate their
        employment voluntarily and immediately begin looking for work.

   b.   Job Losers.  Persons whose employment ends involuntarily, who
        immediately begin looking for work, and those persons who are
        already /on layoff.

   c.   New Job Entrants.  Persons who never worked at a full-time job
        lasting two weeks or longer.

   d.   Job Reentrants.  Persons who previously worked at a full-time job
        lasting two weeks or longer but are out of the labor force prior to
        beginning to look for work.

3.   Not in Labor Force.  All civilians 15 years old and over who are not
classified as employed or unemployed.  These persons are further classified
as major activity:  keeping house, going to school, unable to work because
of long-term physical or mental illness, and other.  The "other" group
includes, for the most part, retired persons.  Persons who report doing
unpaid work in a family farm or business for less than 15 hours are also
classified as not in the labor force.

For persons not in the labor force, data on previous work experience,
intentions to seek work again, desire for a job at the time of interview,
and reasons for not looking for work are asked only in those households
that are in the fourth and eighth months of the sample, i.e., the
"outgoing" groups, those which had been in the sample for three previous
months and would not be in for the subsequent month.

These items are asked in question 24; see the questionnaire facsimile.
Such persons have an LFSR code of 5-7 in character 12 of the person record.

Finally, it should be noted that the unemployment rate represents the
number of persons unemployed as a percent of the civilian labor force 16
years old and over.  This measure can also be computed for groups within
the labor force classified by sex, age, marital status, race, etc.  The job
loser, job leaver, reentrant, and new entrant rates are each calculated as
a percent of the civilian labor force 16 years old and over; the sum of the
rates for the four groups thus equals the total unemployment rate.

Layoff.  A person who is unemployed but expects to be called back to a
specific job.  If he/she expects to be called back within 30 days, it is
considered a temporary layoff; otherwise, it is an indefinite layoff.

Looking for Work.  A person who is trying to get work or trying to
establish a business or profession.

March Supplement Weight.  The March supplement weight is on all person
records and is used to produce "supplement" estimates; that is, income,
work experience, migration, and family characteristic estimates.

Marital Status.  The marital status classification identifies four major
categories:  single (never married), married, widowed, and divorced.  These
terms refer to the marital status at the time of enumeration.

The category "married" is further divided into "married, civilian spouse
present," "married, Armed Force spouse present," "married, spouse ab-
sent," "married, Armed Force spouse absent," and "separated."  A
person is classified as "married, spouse present" if the husband or wife
is reported as a member of the household even though he or she may be
temporarily absent on business or on vacation, visiting, in a hospital,
etc., at the time of the enumeration.  Persons reported as "separated"
included those with legal separations, those living apart with intentions
of obtaining a divorce, and other persons permanently or temporarily
estranged from their spouses because of marital discord.

For the purpose of this file, the group "other marital status" includes
"widowed and divorced," "separated," and "other married, spouse
absent."

Medicare.  The Medicare Program is designed to provide medical care for the
aged and disabled.  The Basic Hospital Insurance Plan (Part A) is designed
to provide basic protection against hospital costs and related post-
hospital services.  This plan also covers many persons under 65 years old
who receive Social Security or railroad retirement benefits based on long-
term disability.  Part A is financed jointly by employers and employees
through Social Security payroll deductions.  Qualified persons 65 years old
and over who are not otherwise eligible for Part A benefits may pay
premiums directly to obtain this coverage.  The Medical Insurance Plan
(Part B) is a voluntary plan which builds upon the hospital insurance
protection provided by the basic plan.  It provides insurance protection
covering physicians' and surgeons' services and a variety of medical and
other health services received either in hospitals or on an ambulatory
basis.  It is financed through monthly premium payments by each enrollee,
and subsidized by Federal general revenue funds.

The Medicare question on the March CPS attempted to identify all persons 15
years old and over who were "covered" by Medicare at any time during the
previous calendar year.  The term "covered" means enrolled in the
Medicare Program.  In order to be counted, the person did not necessarily
have to receive medical care paid for by Medicare.

Medicaid.  The Medicaid Program is designed to provide medical assistance
to needy families with dependent children, and to aged, blind, or perma-
nently and totally disabled individuals whose incomes and resources are
insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.  The program
is administered by State agencies through grants from the Health Care
Financing Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services.
Funding for medical assistance payments consists of a combination of Fed-
eral, State, and in some cases, local funds.

Medicaid is a categorical program with complex eligibility rules which vary
from State to State.  There are two basic groups of eligible individuals:
the categorically eligible and the medically needy.  The major
categorically eligible groups are all Aid to Families with Dependent
Children (AFDC)  recipients and most Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
recipients.  Other categorically eligible groups are (1) those who meet
basic State cash assistance eligibility rules/aged, blind, disabled, needy
single parents with children, and, in some States, needy unemployed parents
with children, but who are not currently receiving money payments; and (2)
needy persons who meet categorical eligibility standards but are
institutionalized for medical reasons (e.g., low-income elderly persons in
nursing homes).  However, such institutionalized persons are not included
in the CPS universe and, therefore, are not reflected in these statistics.

In roughly one-half of the States, coverage is extended to the medically
needy/persons meeting categorical age, sex, or disability criteria, whose
money incomes and assets exceed eligibility levels for cash assistance but
are not sufficient to meet the cost of medical care.  In such States,
qualifying income and asset levels are usually above those set for cash
assistance.  Families with large medical expenses relative to their incomes
and assets may also meet medically needy eligibility standards in these
States.

The Medicaid question on the March CPS attempted to identify all persons
who were "covered" by Medicaid at any time during the previous calendar
year.  The term "covered" means enrolled in the Medicaid program, i.e.,
had a Medicaid medical assistance card, or incurred medical bills which
were paid for by Medicaid.  In order to be counted, the person did not have
to receive medical care paid for by Medicaid.

After data collection and creation of an initial microdata file, further
refinements were made to assign Medicaid coverage to children.  In this
procedure all children under 21 years old in families were assumed to be
covered by Medicaid if either the householder or spouse reported being
covered by Medicaid (this procedure was required mainly because the
Medicaid coverage question was asked only for persons 15 years old and
over).  All adult AFDC recipients and their children, and SSI recipients
living in States which legally require Medicaid coverage of all SSI
recipients, were also assigned coverage.

Mobility Status.  The population of the United States, 15 years old and
over, is classified according to mobility status on the basis of a
comparison between the place of residence of each individual at the time of
the March CPS and the place of residence in March of the previous year.

The information on mobility status is obtained from the responses to a
series of inquiries. The first of three inquiries is:  "Was...living in
this house 1 year ago...?"  If the answer was "No," the enumerator
asked, "Where did...live on March 1, 1988?"  In classification, three
main categories distinguish nonmovers, movers, and movers from abroad.

Nonmovers are all persons who are living in the same house at the end of
the period as at the beginning of the period.  Movers are all persons who
are living in a different house at the end of the period than at the
beginning of the period.  Movers from abroad include all persons, either
citizens or aliens, whose place of residence is outside the United States
at the beginning of the period, that is, in an outlying area under the
jurisdiction of the United States or in a foreign country.  The mobility
status for children is fully allocated from the mother if she is in the
household; otherwise it is allocated from the householder.

Month-In-Sample.  The term is defined as the number of times a unit is
interviewed.  Each unit is interviewed eight times during the life of the
sample.

Never Worked.  A person who has never held a full-time civilian job lasting
two consecutive weeks or more.

Nonfamily Householder.  A nonfamily householder (formerly called a primary
individual) is a person maintaining a household while living alone or with
nonrelatives only.

Nonfarm Self-employment Net Income.  The term is defined as net money
income (gross receipts minus expenses) from an individual's own business,
professional enterprise, or partnership.  Gross receipts include the value
of all goods sold and services rendered.  Expenses include costs of goods
purchased, rent, heat, light, power, depreciation charges, wages and
salaries paid, business taxes (not personal income taxes), etc.  In
general, inventory changes are considered in determining net income;
replies based on income tax returns or other official records do reflect
inventory changes; however, when values of inventory changes are not
reported, net income figures exclusive of inventory changes are accepted.
The value of saleable merchandise consumed by the proprietors of retail
stores is not included as part of net income.

Nonworker.  A person who did not do any work in the calendar year preceding
the survey.

Nonrelative of Householder With No Own Relatives in Household.  A
nonrelative of the householder who has no relative(s) of his own in the
household.  This category includes such nonrelatives as a ward, a lodger, a
servant, or a hired hand, who has no relatives of his own living with him
in the household.

Nonrelative of Householder With Own Relatives (Including Spouse) in
Household.  Any household member who is not related to the householder but
has relatives of his own in the household; for example, a lodger, his
spouse, and their son.

Other Relative of Householder.  Any relative of the householder other than
his spouse, child (including natural, adopted, foster, or step child),
sibling, or parent; for example, grandson, daughter-in-law, etc.

Own Child.  A child related by birth, marriage, or adoption to the family
householder.

Part-Time, Economic Reasons.  The item includes slack work, material
shortages, repairs to plant or equipment, start or termination of job dur-
ing the week, and inability to find full-time work.  (See also Full-Time
Worker.)

Part-Time Other Reasons.  The item includes labor dispute, bad weather, own
illness, vacation, demands of home housework, school, no desire for full-
time work, and full-time worker only during peak season.

Part-Time Work.  Persons who work between 1 and 34 hours are designated as
working "part-time" in the current job held during the reference week.
For the March supplement, a person is classified as having worked part-time
during the preceding calendar year if he worked less than 35 hours per week
in a majority of the weeks in which he worked during the year.  Conversely,
he is classified as having worked full-time if he worked 35 hours or more
per week during a majority of the weeks in which he worked.

Part-Year Work.  Part-year work is classified as less than 50 weeks' work.

Pension Plan.  The pension plan question on the March CPS attempted to
identify if pension plan coverage was available through an employer or
union and if the employee was included.  This information was collected for
civilian persons 15 years old and over who worked during the previous
calendar year.

Population Coverage.  Population coverage includes the civilian population
of the United States plus approximately 820,000 members of the Armed Forces
in the United States living off post or with their families on post but
excludes all other members of the Armed Forces.  This file excludes inmates
of institutions.  The labor force and work experience data are not
collected for Armed Forces members.

Poverty.  In this file, families and unrelated individuals are classified
as being above or below the poverty level using a poverty index adopted by
a Federal Interagency Committee in 1969 and slightly modified in 1981.

The modified index provides a range of income cutoffs or "poverty
thresholds" adjusted to take into account family size, number of children,
and age of the family householder or unrelated individual; prior to 1981,
adjustments were also made on the basis of farm-nonfarm residence and sex
of the householder.  The impact of these revisions on the poverty estimates
is minimal at the national level.  The poverty cutoffs are updated every
year to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index.  The average poverty
threshold for a family of four was $12,091 in 1985.  For a detailed
explanation of the poverty definition, see Current Population Reports,
Series P-60, No. 154, Money Income and Poverty Status of Persons in the
United States:  1988.

Public Assistance.  (See Income.)

Public or Other Subsidized Housing.  Participation in public housing is
determined by two factors:  program eligibility and the availability of
housing.  Income standards for initial and continuing occupancy vary by lo-
cal housing authority, although the limits are constrained by Federal
guidelines.  Rental charges, which, in turn, define net benefits, are set
by a Federal statute not to exceed 30 percent of net monthly money income.
A recipient unit can either be a family of two or more related persons or
an individual who is handicapped, elderly, or displaced by urban renewal or
natural disaster.

There are some programs through which housing assistance is provided to
low-income families and individuals living in public or privately owned
dwellings.  Two of the more common types of programs in which Federal,
State, and local funds are used to subsidize private sector housing are
rent supplement and interest reduction plans.  Under a rent supplement plan
the difference between the "fair market" rent and the rent charged to the
tenant is paid to the owner by a government agency.  Under an interest
reduction program the amount of interest paid on the mortgage by the owner
is reduced so that subsequent savings can be passed along to low income
tenants in the form of lower rent charges.

There were two questions dealing with public and low cost housing on the
March CPS supplement questionnaire.  The first question identifies resi-
dence in a housing unit owned by a public agency.  The second question
identifies beneficiaries who were not living in public housing projects,
but who were paying lower rent due to a government subsidy.  These
questions differ from other questions covering noncash benefits in that
they establish current recipiency status in March of the current year
rather than recipiency status during the previous year.

Race.  The population is divided into five groups on the basis of race:
White, Black, American Indian/Aleut Eskimo, Asian or Pacific Islander and
Other races beginning with March 1989.  The last category includes any
other race except the four mentioned.  In most of the published tables,
"Other Races" are shown in total population.

Receipts Not Counted as Income.  Receipts from the following sources are
not included as income:  (1) money received from the sale of property, such
as stocks, bonds, a house, or a car (unless the person was engaged in the
business of selling such property, in which case the net proceeds would be
counted as income from self-employment); (2) withdrawals of bank deposits;
(3) money borrowed; (4) tax refunds; (5) gifts; and (6) lump-sum in-
heritances or insurance payments.

Reentrants.  Persons who previously worked at a full-time job lasting two
weeks or longer but who are out of the labor force prior to beginning to
look for work.

Related Children.  Related children in a family include own children and
all other children in the household who are related to the householder by
birth, marriage, or adoption.  For each type of family unit identified in
the CPS, the count of own children under 18 years old is limited to single
(never married) children; however, "own children under 25" and "own
children of any age," include all children regardless of marital status.
The totals include never-married children living away from home in college
dormitories.

Related Subfamily.  A related subfamily is a married couple with or without
children, or one parent with one or more own single (never married)
children under 18 years old, living in a household and related to, but not
including, the householder or spouse.  The most common example of a related
subfamily is a young married couple sharing the home of the husband's or
wife's parents.  The number of related subfamilies is not included in the
number of families.

School.  A person who spent most of his time during the survey week
attending any kind of public or private school, including trade or
vocational schools in which students receive no compensation in money or
kind.

School Lunches.  The National School Lunch Program is designed to assist
States in providing a school lunch for all children at moderate cost.  The
National School Lunch Act of 1946 was further amended in 1970 to provide
free and reduced-price school lunches for children of needy families.  The
program is administered by the Food and Nutrition Service of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) through State educational agencies or
through regional USDA nutrition services for nonprofit private schools.
The program is funded by a combination of Federal funds and matching State
funds.

All students eating lunches prepared at participating schools pay less than
the total cost of the lunches.  Some students pay the "full established"
price for lunch (which itself is subsidized) while others pay a "reduced"
price for lunch, and still others receive a "free" lunch.  Program
regulations require students receiving free lunches to live in households
with incomes below 125 percent of the official poverty level.  Those
students receiving a reduced-price school lunch (10 to 20 cents per meal)
live in households with incomes between 125 percent and 195 percent of the
official poverty level.  The data in this file, however, do not distinguish
between recipiency of free and reduced-price school lunches.

The questions on the March CPS provide a very limited amount of data for
the school lunch program.  Questions concerning the school lunch program
were designed to identify the number of members 5 to 18 years old in
households who "usually" ate a hot lunch.  This defined the universe of
household members usually receiving this noncash benefit.  This was
followed by a question to identify the number of members receiving free or
reduced price lunches.

Self-Employed.  Self-employed persons are those who work for profit or fees
in their own business, profession or trade, or operate a farm.

Stretches of Unemployment.  A continuous stretch is one that is not
interrupted by the person getting a job or leaving the labor market to go
to school, to keep house, etc.  A period of two weeks or more during which
a person is employed or ceased looking for work is considered to break the
continuity of the period of seeking work.

Topcode.  For confidentiality purposes, usual hourly earnings from the
current job and earnings from the longest job are topcoded, i.e., cut off
at a particular amount.

Refer to Appendix F for an explanation and topcode values of hourly
earnings from the current job.  Earnings from the longest job are collected
during enumeration up to $299,999; however, the amount is topcoded on the
public use file at $99,999.

From the supplement, total person's income is the sum of the amounts from
the individual income types; total family income is the sum of the total
persons income for each family member; total household income is the sum of
the total income for each person in the household.

Total Money Income.  The term is defined as the arithmetic sum of money
wages and salaries, net income from self-employment, and income other than
earnings.  The total income of a household is the arithmetic sum of the
amounts received by all income recipients in the household.

Unable to Work.  A person is classified as unable to work because of long-
term physical or mental illness, lasting six months or longer.

Unemployed.  (See Labor Force.)

Unemployment Compensation.  (See Income.)

Unpaid Family Workers.  Unpaid family workers are persons working without
pay for 15 hours a week or more on a farm or in a business operated by a
member of the household to whom they are related by birth or marriage.

Unrelated Individuals.  Unrelated individuals are persons of any age (other
than inmates of institutions) who are not living with any relatives.  An
unrelated individual may be (1) a nonfamily householder living alone or
with nonrelatives only, (2) a roomer, boarder, or resident employee with no
relatives in the household, or (3) a group quarters member who has no
relatives living with him/her.  Thus, a widow who occupies her house alone
or with one or more other persons not related to her, a roomer not related
to anyone else in the housing unit, a maid living as a member of her
employer's household but with no relatives in the household, and a resident
staff member in a hospital living apart from any relatives are all examples
of unrelated individuals.

Unrelated Subfamily.  An unrelated subfamily is a family that does not
include among its members the householder and relatives of the householder.
Members of unrelated subfamilies may include persons such as guests,
roomers, boarders, or resident employees and their relatives living in a
household.  The number of unrelated subfamily members is included in the
number of household members but is not included in the count of family
members.

Persons living with relatives in group quarters were formerly considered as
members of families.  However, the number of such unrelated subfamilies is
so small that persons in these unrelated subfamilies are included in the
count of secondary individuals.

Veteran Status.  If a person served at any time during the four major wars
of this century, the code for the most recent wartime service is entered.
The following codes are used:

0    Females, children under 15
1    Vietnam era
2    Korean
3    WWI
4    WWII
5    Other Service
6    Nonveteran

Wage and Salary Workers.  Wage and salary workers receive wages, salary,
commission, tips, or pay in kind from a private employer or from a gov-
ernmental unit.  Also included are persons who are self-employed in an
incorporated business.  (See income.)

Weeks Worked in the Income Year.  Persons are classified according to the
number of different weeks, during the preceding calendar year, in which
they did any civilian work for pay or profit (including paid vacations and
sick leave) or worked without pay on a family-operated farm or business.

Workers.  (See Labor Force--Employed.)

Work Experience.  Includes those persons who during the preceding calendar
year did any work for pay or profit or worked without pay on a family-op-
erated farm or business at any time during the year, on a part-time or
full-time basis.

Year-Round Full-Time Worker.  A year-round full-time worker is one who
usually worked 35 hours or more per week for 50 weeks or more during the
preceding calendar year.

Years of School Completed.  Data on years of school completed are derived
from the combination of answers to questions concerning the highest grade
of school attended by the person and whether or not that grade is finished.
Educational attainment applies only to progress in "regular" school.
Such schools include graded public, private, and parochial elementary and
high schools (both junior and senior high), colleges, universities, and
professional schools, whether day schools or night schools.  Thus, regular
schooling is that which may advance a person toward an elementary school
certificate or high school diploma, or a college, university, or pro-
fessional school degree.  Schooling in other than regular schools is
counted only if the credits obtained are regarded as transferable to a
school in the regular school system.

                        HOW TO USE THE DATA DICTIONARY


The Data Dictionary describes the contents and record layout of the
public-use computer tape file.  The first line of each data item
description gives the data name, size of the data field, relative begin
position of the field, and the range of the values.

The next few lines contain descriptive text and any applicable notes.
Categorical value codes and labels are given where needed.  Comment
notes marked by an (*) are provided throughout.  Comments should be
removed from the machine-readable version of the data dictionary before
using it to help access the data file.

Data.  Alphabetic, numeric, and the special character (-).  No other
special characters are used.  It may be a mnemonic such as "H-HHTYPE"
or "HFIN-YN", or a sequential identifier such as "MIG-MTR1" or
"SUR-SC1".  Data item names are unique throughout the entire file
(all 3 record types).

Size.  Numeric.  The size of a data item is given in characters.
Indication of implied decimal places is provided in notes.

Begin.  Numeric.  Contains the location in the data record of the first
character position of the data item field.

Category Value.  Numeric.  Contains the range of values for the given
data item.

The first line of each data item description begins with the character
"D" (left-justified, two characters).  The "D" flag indicates lines
in the data dictionary containing the name, size, and begin position of
each data item.  This information (in machine-readable form) can be
used to help access the data file.  The line beginning with the
character "U" describes the universe for that item.  Lines containing
categorical value codes and labels follow next and begin with the
character "V".  The special character (.) denotes the start of the
value labels.  Two examples of data item descriptions follow:

       D H-HHTYPE    1     20       (1:3)

How to Distinguish Supplement Variables from Monthly Variables

Monthly variables have a prefix and trailer as follows:

       1.   H-, HG-, or H% for household record variables.
       2.   A-, A% for person record variables.
       3.   The family record contains no monthly variables.


Supplement variables are all one string or they have a suffix.  For
example HFIN-YN is a supplement variable on the household record.

                       MATCHING OF MARCH CPS FILES


There are two basic limitations in linking the March CPS files across
years.  First, only fifty percent of the sample is included in two
consecutive years.  Second, the residents within the eligible housing
units may have changed or appeared as noninterview records in one or
both years.  The result is a matched sample of considerably less than
the upper limit of fifty percent.  The basic procedures and variables
used to link two or more March CPS files are outlined below.

Sample Selection

The first step in matching year t with year t+1 is to select from year
t those housing units with a "month in sample" value of 1 through 4,
and from year t+1 those units with a "month in sample" value of 5
through 8.  This will identify the sample subset eligible for matching.
Within this subset, housing units in year t, month 1 will match only
with units in year t+1, month 5, etc.

Matching Housing Units

Using one or more variables, it is possible to uniquely identify each
housing unit in each sample rotation.  However, because of changes in
CPS procedures, the available information for matching housing units is
not always identical.  Below are the variables available for matching
March CPS files.

Years:      1968-1971
Variables:  Random Cluster Code (F6-10) and Serial Number (F11-14)

Years:      1971-1972
            Changes in CPS clustering procedures and the accompanying
            change of household identification numbers prevent matching
            1971 and 1972 March CPS files.

Years:      1972-1973
            The 1972 file uses 1960 random cluster codes while the 1973
            file uses 1970 random cluster codes, thus precluding the
            matching of records.

Years:      1973-1975
Variables:  Random Cluster Code (F7-11).  Segment Number (F12-16), and
            Serial Number (F217-218)

Years:      1975-1976
Variables:  1975:  Random Cluster Code (F7-11) Segment Number (F12-16),
            and Serial Number (F217-218)
            1976:  Random Cluster Code (H35-39), Segment Number (H40-
            43), and Serial Number  (H44-45)

Years:      1976-1977
            Matching is not possible because variables required for
            matching are in a different format each year.

Years:      1977-1985
Variable:   Household Identification Number (H18-29)

Years:      1985-1986
            Matching is not possible because the 1986 file is based
            entirely on the 1980 census design sample.

Years:      1986 Forward
Variable:   Household Identification Number (H18-29)

Matching Households, Families, and Persons

Although the information presented above allows matching of housing
units across years, it is possible that the residents of the housing
unit have changed.  Consequently, it is necessary to perform additional
matches to insure resident comparability.  The specific variables used
to match residents will vary according to the needs of the project but
it is more efficient to arrange the matching in a hierarchical
sequence.   For example, matching on sex and race should precede
matching on age or household relationship.  The user should carefully
work through the possible changes in household structure that might
result in an inappropriate rejection of a household.  For example, a
husband-wife family in year t that experienced a divorce and became a
female headed household in year t+1 would fail the test for matching
sex of head.  Clearly, the more criteria used in matching records will 
result in greater accuracy, but will also increase the expense and result 
in fewer matches.
                                     OVERVIEW

                             Current Population Survey

Introduction

The Current Population Survey (CPS) is the source of the official
Government statistics on employment and unemployment.  The CPS has been
conducted monthly for over 50 years.  Currently, we interview about 57,000
households monthly, scientifically selected on the basis of area of
residence to represent the Nation as a whole, individual States, and other
specified areas.  Each household is interviewed once a month for four
consecutive months one year, and again for the corresponding time period a
year later.  This technique enables us to obtain month-to-month and year-
to-year comparisons at a reasonable cost while minimizing the inconvenience
to any one household.

Although the main purpose of the survey is to collect information on the
employment situation, a very important secondary purpose is to collect
information on the demographic status of the population, information such
as age, sex, race, marital status, educational attainment, and family
structure.  From time to time additional questions are included on such
important subjects as health, education, income, and previous work
experience.  The statistics resulting from these questions serve to update
similar information collected once every 10 years through the decennial
census, and are used by Government policymakers and legislators as
important indicators of our Nation's economic situation and for planning
and evaluating many Government programs.

The CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of
the population of the United States.  Because it is not possible to develop
one or two overall figures (such as the number of unemployed) that would
adequately describe the labor market, the CPS is designed to provide a
large amount of detailed and supplementary data.  Such data are made
available to meet a wide variety of needs on the part of users of labor
market information.

Thus, the CPS is the only source of monthly estimates of total employment
(both farm and nonfarm); nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and
unpaid workers in nonfarm family enterprises; wage and salary employees;
and, finally, estimates of total unemployment.

It provides the only available distribution of workers by the number of
hours worked (as distinguished from aggregate or average hours for an
industry), permitting separate analyses of part-time workers, workers on
overtime, etc.  The survey is also the only comprehensive current source of
information on the occupation of workers and the industries in which they
work.  Information is available from the survey not only for persons
currently in the labor force but also for those who are outside the labor
force.  The characteristics of such persons - whether married women with or
without young children, disabled persons, students, older retired workers,
etc., can be determined.  Information on their current desire for work,
their past work experience, and their intentions as to job seeking are also
available.

The March CPS, also known as the Annual Demographic File, contains the
basic monthly demographic and labor force data described above, plus
additional data on work experience, income, noncash benefits, and
migration.

CPS Sample

The CPS sample is based on the civilian noninstitutional population of the
United States.  The sample is located in 729 sample areas comprising 1,973
counties and independent cities with coverage in every State and in the
District of Columbia.

In all, some 71,000 housing units or other living quarters are assigned for
interview each month; about 57,000 of them containing approximately 114,500
persons 15 years old and over are interviewed.  Also included are
demographic data for approximately 33,500 children 0-14 years old and 650
Armed Forces members living with civilians either on or off base within
these households.  The remainder of the assigned housing units are found to
be vacant, converted to nonresidential use, contain persons with residence
elsewhere, or are not interviewed because the residents are not found at
home after repeated calls, are temporarily absent, or are unavailable for
other reasons.  Approximately 14,000 noninterview households are present
each month.  The resulting file size is approximately 163,000 records.  In
March of each year supplemental data are collected for Armed Forces members
residing with their families in civilian housing units or on a military
base.  The Armed Forces members, however, are not asked the monthly labor
force questions.  In addition, the March CPS is supplemented with a sample
of Hispanic households identified the previous November.  This results in
the addition of about 2,500 households in the March CPS.  The inclusion of
the additional sample of Hispanic households began in 1976.

A more precise explanation regarding the CPS sample design is provided in
Technical Paper 40, The Current Population Survey:  Design and Methodology.

For a more detailed discussion about the basic labor force data gathered on
a monthly basis in the CPS survey, see the Bureau of Labor Statistics
Report No. 463 and the Current Population Report P-23, No. 62, issued
jointly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of the Census in
October, 1976, and entitled Concepts and Methods Used In Labor Statistics
derived from the Current Population Survey.

Questionnaire Coverage

Questionnaire facsimiles of the March 1990 CPS income supplement are shown
on pages D-13 to D-27 in this documentation.  CPS-1 items 19-26B shown on
pages D-4 and D-5 of this document are not asked of Armed Forces members
but only of civilians 15 years old and older.  This part of the
questionnaire is referred to as the monthly (basic) labor force section
because these questions are asked every month.

Certain data items appearing on both the monthly (basic) questionnaire and
the March supplement questionnaire may not have the same meaning.  To avoid
any misunderstandings, the user should refer to the glossary of this

Revisions To The March CPS Processing System

Introduction.  Between 1988 and 1989 a new computer processing system was
introduced for the March Current Population Survey.  This processing system
rewrite was long overdue; the system in use before this year was first
introduced in March 1976 and was never fully updated to reflect the
numerous questionnaire changes that had taken place since that time.  In
addition, the programs used to process the CPS file were written in a
computer language that is being phased out of use at the Census Bureau.
While the March 1989 file is the first to reflect this new processing sys-
tem, the March 1988 file was reprocessed based on these new procedures in
order to: 1) better evaluate the new processing procedures, and 2) allow
year-to-year comparisons to be made between income years 1987 and 1988
using a consistent processing system.

While the following section deals mainly with modifications to the March
imputation procedures and their subsequent effect on income and poverty
rates, it should be pointed out that all of the processing programs were
rewritten in 1989, so that not only are the files from 1989 forward based
on a somewhat different imputation system, but also reflect a rewritten
weighting system, data acceptance program, family relationship edits, and
new procedures to match income supplement records to the monthly CPS file.
As a result, it is difficult to ascertain whether differences (especially
those based on relatively small bases) are the result of imputation or
other processing differences between the original and revised files.

Since the Census Bureau began imputing the missing income data on the CPS
in 1962, there have been three major revisions to the processing system (in
1967, 1976, and 1989).  Through all of these revisions, the basic strategy
used in make imputations has remained the same.  This approach, commonly
referred to as ``hot deck'' imputation, assigns missing responses to sample
persons with information from matched sample persons with similar
demographic and economic information who answered these questions.

Under the new March processing system, there were three main modifications
to the income imputation programs:

1.  The edits and imputations were expanded to reflect the
    full detail of the March income questionnaire.  The
    original processing system was still based on a less
    detailed CPS income questionnaire that had not been in
    use since 1980.

2.  Under the revised processing procedures, entire sets of
    March income and noncash benefits data were imputed to
    supplement noninterviews from the same interviewed
    person.  Under the original processing procedures,
    earnings, unearned income, and noncash benefits were
    imputed in separate stages during the processing system.
    Thus, the new processing system imputes noninterviews
    more efficiently and is better able to preserve the
    correlation between earnings, unearned income, and
    noncash benefits.

3.  Both the old and new processing systems employ what are
    called ``statistical matches'' to link sample cases with
    reported data to those requiring imputation for missing
    responses.  In the original processing system, under
    certain circumstances, reported data was removed and
    replaced with imputed data during the statistical matching
    process.  Under the new system, reported data are never
    removed.  This was accomplished by expanding the number of
    statistical matches in the income imputation system.

File Structure

There is a household record for each household or group quarters.  The
household record is followed by one of three possible structures:

A.  If the household contains related persons and is not a group
    quarters household:

    1.  The family record appears next followed by person records
        for members of the family who are not also members of a
        related subfamily.  The person records would be ordered:
        family householder, spouse of family householder,
        children in the family, and other relatives of the family
        householder.

    2.  The above records may be followed by one or more related
        subfamily records, each related subfamily record being
        followed immediately by person records for members of
        that related subfamily.  The person records would be
        ordered:  reference person of the related subfamily,
        spouse of subfamily reference person, and children of
        subfamily reference person.

    3.  The above records may be followed by one or more
        unrelated subfamily records, each unrelated subfamily
        record being followed immediately by person records for
        members of that unrelated subfamily.  The person  records
        would be ordered:  unrelated subfamily reference person,
        spouse  of subfamily reference person, and children of
        subfamily reference  person.

    4.  The above records may be followed by one or more persons
        living with nonrelatives family records, each to be
        followed by the person record  for the unrelated
        individual it represents.  (See Figure 1, page 2-4.)

B.  If the household contains a householder with no relatives and
    is not a group quarters household:

    1.  The family record for the nonfamily householder is
        followed immediately  by the person record for that
        nonfamily householder.

    2.  These records may be followed by one or more unrelated
        subfamily  records, each unrelated subfamily record
        being followed immediately by the person records for
        members of that unrelated subfamily.

    3.  These records may be followed by one or more family
        records for persons living with nonrelatives, each person
        living with nonrelatives family  record being followed
        immediately by the person record for that person  living
        with nonrelatives.  (See Figure 2, page 2-5.)

C.  If the household is a group quarters, each person is defined
    as a person living with nonrelatives.  There will be a family
    record followed by a person record for each person in the
    group quarters.

Relationship of Current Population Survey Files to Publications

Each month, a significant amount of information about the labor force is
published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Employment and Earnings
and  Monthly Labor Review Reports.

As mentioned previously, the CPS also serves as a vehicle for supplemental
inquiries on subjects other than employment which are periodically added to
the  questionnaire.  From the basic and supplemental data the Bureau of the
Census issues four series of publications under the general title Current
Population  Reports:

P-20  Population Characteristics
P-23  Special Studies
P-27  Farm Population
P-60  Consumer Income

Of particular interest to users of the March microdata file would be those
reports based on information collected in March.  These reports include the
following titles:

P-20  Population Profile of the United States:  (Year)
P-20  Household and Family Characteristics:  March (Year)
P-20  Households, Families, Marital Status, and Living
      Arrangements:  March (Year)
P-20  Geographical Mobility (Years)
P-20  Educational Attainment in the United States (Years)

      the United States:  (Year)
P-60  Characteristics of the Population Below the Poverty Level:  (Year)
P-60  Characteristics of Households Receiving Selected Noncash Benefits:
      (Year)

All Current Population Reports may be obtained by subscription from the
U.S. Government Printing Office.  Subscriptions are available as follows:

Geographic Limitations

In July 1985, the CPS microdata files began carrying the metropolitan
statistical area definitions announced by the Office of Management and
Budget on June 30, 1984.  The new CPS estimates for the total metropolitan
population have consistently been higher than independent estimates of the
total metropolitan population prepared by the Census Bureau; the new CPS
nonmetropolitan estimates have been lower than the independent estimates.
The magnitude of the monthly differences has varied from 900,000 to 2.5
million persons over the past year, so that the proportion of the
population living in metropolitan areas according to the CPS has ranged
from 0.4 to 1.0 percentage points higher than the independent estimate.
The difference in level between the two sets of estimates is partially
attributable to the basic CPS sample design, which, because of sampling
variability, includes an oversample of metropolitan households and an
undersample of nonmetropolitan households.  The monthly variations result
from the exit and entrance of rotation groups, each with slightly different
metropolitan-nonmetropolitan proportions, into the sample.  The apparent
overestimation of metropolitan and underestimation of nonmetropolitan
population in the CPS relative to the Census Bureau's independent estimates
should be taken into account when using the data.  Because of the monthly
variation in these estimates, month-to-month comparisons of metropolitan
and nonmetropolitan estimates should be interpreted with caution.

One other set of estimates that can be produced from CPS microdata files
beginning in October 1985 should be treated with caution.  These are
estimates for individual metropolitan areas.  The change in Census Bureau
confidentiality rules allowing identification of areas with populations of
100,000 or more instead of 250,000 has produced a situation where we now
identify numerous small metropolitan areas on the CPS data files. Although
estimates for the larger areas such as New York, Los Angeles, and so forth,
should be fairly accurate and valid for a multitude of uses, estimates for
the smaller metropolitan areas (those with populations under 500,000)
should be used with caution because of the relatively large sampling
variability associated with these estimates.

It should be kept in mind that the sample design and methods of weighting
CPS data are geared towards producing estimates for the entire Nation.
Consequently, data for states are not as reliable as national data, and the
file will lose some of its utility in certain applications.  For further
discussion of such considerations, the user should consult The Current
Population Survey:  Design and Methodology (Technical Paper 40, U.S. Bureau
of the Census).

The nature of the work done by each individual investigator using the
microdata file will determine to what extent his/her requirements for
precision will allow using some of the smaller geographic areas identified
on the file.

Weights

For all CPS data files a single weight is prepared and used to compute the
monthly labor force status estimates.  An additional weight was prepared
for the earnings universe which roughly corresponds to wage and salary
workers in the two outgoing rotations.  This is explained below in the
section on earnings data.  However, the difference in content of the March
CPS supplement requires the presentation of additional weights:  a
household weight, a family weight, and a March supplement weight.  In this
section we briefly describe the construction and use of these weights.
Chapter 5 of Technical paper 40, The Current Population Survey:  Design and
Methodology provides documentation of the weighting procedures for the CPS
both with and without supplement questions.

The final weight, which is the product of several adjustments, is used to
produce population estimates for the various items covered in the regular
monthly CPS.  This weight is constructed from the basic weight for each
person, which represents the probability of selection for the survey.  The
basic weight is adjusted for special sampling situations and failure to
obtain interviews from eligible households (noninterview adjustment).  A
two-stage ratio estimation procedure adjusts the sample population to the
known distribution of the entire population.  This two-stage ratio
estimation process produces factors which are applied to the basic weight
(after the special weighting and noninterview adjustments are made) and
results in the final weight associated with each record.  In summary, the
final weight is the product of:  (1) the basic weight, (2) adjustments for
special weighting, (3) noninterview adjustment, (4) first stage ratio
adjustment factor, and (5) second stage ratio adjustment factor.  This
final weight should be used when producing estimates from the basic CPS
data.

Differences in the questionnaire, sample and data uses for the March CPS
supplement result in the need for additional adjustment procedures to
produce what is called the March supplement weight.  The sample for the
March CPS supplement is expanded to include male members of the Armed
Forces who are living in civilian housing or with the family on a military
base, as well as additional Hispanic households which are not included in
the monthly labor force estimates.

The expanded sample and the need to have a husband and wife receive the
same weight has resulted in a weighting system which produces the March
supplement weight.  The March supplement weight should be used for
producing estimates from March supplement data.

Finally, household and family weights are the weights assigned from the
householder or reference person after all adjustments have been made and
should be used when tabulating estimates of families-households.

Earnings Data

Beginning in 1982, usual hourly and weekly earnings data appear on the
Annual Demographic File (ADF) for that portion of the population roughly
corresponding to wage and salary workers (self-employed persons in
incorporated businesses are excluded, although they are normally included
with the wage and salary population).  These data are now collected on a
monthly basis in the two outgoing rotation groups as part of the basic CPS
labor force interview.

Since the intent of the regular collection of earnings data was to initiate
a family earnings data series, all persons in the two outgoing rotations
receive an ``earnings weight,'' even if they are not eligible for the
earnings item.  The earnings weight is a simple ratio-estimation to the
person's labor force status by age, race, and sex.  When tabulating
estimates of earnings based on basic CPS data, use the earnings weight.

Further information on this earnings series is contained in Technical
Description of the Quarterly Data on Weekly Earnings from the Current
Population Survey, BLS Report #601, July 1980.  This report is available on
request from the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics,
Washington, D.C.  20212.  Attn:  Office of Inquiries and Correspondence.

NOTE:  For 1982 and 1983, usual weekly earnings are not present for
individuals who were not paid on an hourly basis.

             RELATIONSHIP OF QUESTIONNAIRE ITEMS TO FIELD 
                NAMES ON THE ANNUAL DEMOGRAPHIC FILE 


In March 1989 the processing system was updated to reflect the detailed 
items on the income supplement questionnaire (CPS-665).  The figures on the
following pages show how the questionnaire items were reformatted prior to 
1989 into income fields on the annual demographic file and how they are now
formatted on the file.  

Figure 1 on page 6-3 lists the following information:

    1.     Item number on the questionnaire

    2.    Name of field on the annual demographic file from 1989 forward

    3.     Income type

    4.     Name of field on annual demographic file prior to 1989

Figure 2 on page 6-5 lists the following information:

    1.     Name of the field on the annual demographic field from 1989 
           forward 
    2.     Income type

    3.     Name of the field on the annual demographic file prior to 1989

                   Current Population Survey, March 1989

Estimates of the number of persons and families below the poverty level in
1988 derived from this public use version of the March 1989 CPS file differ
slightly from poverty estimates published in the report ``Money Income and
Poverty Status in the United States:  1988 (Advance Data from the March
1989 Current Population Survey),'' Series P-60, No. 166.  A problem with
the weighting was found after the publication of the advance report.
Specifically, children under 15 years of age in families with a household
in the Armed Forces received a weight of 0 instead of a positive weight.
This public use version of the March 1989 CPS file has been reweighted to
correct this problem.  Revised poverty estimates will be published in the
final poverty report ``Poverty in the United States:  1988'', which is
currently scheduled for publication in June 1990.

Table A (attached) shows the effect of reweighting on the 1988 poverty
estimates.  The number of families and their poverty rate essentially did
not change.  The number of families declined by 2,000 (from 6,876,000 to
6,874,000) and the poverty rate remained unchanged (10.4 percent).  The
number of persons below poverty decreased by 133,000 (from 31,878,000 to
31,745,000) and the poverty rate decreased by 0.1 percentage points (from
13.1 to 13.0 percent).  These changes were within sampling error (with one
standard deviation of 563,000 persons and 0.2 percentage points).  Most of
these changes were in the under 18 years of age group.  The number of
persons under 18 years in poverty decreased by 129,000 (from 12,584,000 to
12,455,000) and the poverty rate decreased by 0.2 percentage points (from
19.7 to 19.5 percent).
